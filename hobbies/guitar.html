Introduction

</h1>
<br>
<p1 class="headertext2">

Greetings, fellow music enthusiasts!

<br><br>
My name is Rithwik Prattipati, and I'm thrilled to share my passion for the guitar, an instrument that has captivated hearts and ignited melodies for centuries. Today, we embark on a musical journey to explore this versatile instrument, delving into its history, structure, and the fundamentals that make it a gateway to a world of sonic expression.

<br><br>

The guitar, with its six strings and resonating body, has evolved over time, becoming a staple in various musical genres, from the soulful blues to the electrifying rock and roll. Its versatility lies in its ability to produce a wide range of sounds, from delicate fingerpicking to powerful strumming, making it a beloved companion for musicians worldwide.

What is a guitar?
</h1>
<p1 class="headertext2">
According to Britannica passage, "Guitar", the passage verifies, "A guitar is a plucked-string instrument that makes varied sounds that can turn into music."

Guitar Variations
</h1>
<br>
<p1 class="headertext2">

There are numerous variations of the guitar. One of the more common versions are the acoustic guitar, which has more soft and mellow sound.  Another variation of a guitar that you might have heard is the electric guitar. Electric guitars that you might think of, are the guitars that are listed in the picture above. Electric guitars can be any guitars, as long as they can be plugged into an amplifier and can increase volume from both the guitar and the amplifier.

Guitar Notes
</h1>
<br>
<p1 class="headertext2">
Here is a small video that I made about guitar notations. 
<br><br>
These are a few notes that are included on the guitar fretboard. What is shown in the video are only the open string notes, but these are other notes that are fundamental to play the guitar.

Guitar Chords
</h1>

<p1 class="headertext2">

Guitar chords are a fundamental part of music. Guitar chords are basically played with 2 or more simultaneously notes that creates a certain type of progression. Chords can be really simple, or they can be so hard that it bleeds out your fingers (Seriously... Personal experience!)  There are many variations of chords, like open chords, barre chords, and power chords. Some of the more easier chords is the Am chord, or the Em chord. These chords only require 2 to 3 fingers in order to play this chord.

NOW THE FUN PART.. HOW TO PLAY THE GUITAR
</h1>
<p1 class="headertext2">
Let's start with the guitar posture. Here is the picture of proper guitar posture. In the picture below, this is a perfect example of guitar posture, showing that your elbow should be resting on the head of the guitar, and your other hand's wrist should be resting on the neck, as shown.
